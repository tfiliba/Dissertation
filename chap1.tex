Traditionally, observatories designed custom instruments that would run on one telescope and solve one problem.
This custom approach was the only way to get the requisite processing power to analyze the radio signals.
This resulted in costly designs, because the boards, backplanes, chips, protocols, and software all needed to be designed from scratch.
To make matters worse, this approach resulted in a very long design cycle,  requiring 5-10 years of development before an instrument could be deployed at a telescope and the time the instrument was released, the hardware would be out of date.

Due to their custom implementations, these instruments also lacked flexibility. 
Each instrument was designed specifically for a single purpose.
This meant upgrading the hardware or modifying the algorithm would require a complete redesign of the instrument, and another long design cycle.


While these older designs needed to trade off flexibility for performance, newer technology can offer both performance and flexibility.
Programmable devices such as FPGAs, GPUs and even CPUs can provide enough processing power to keep up with the data from many new telescopes.
These devices make it easy to reprogram existing hardware to support newer algorithms, and, since they are programmed using portable languages, provide a quick path to upgrade hardware without redesigning the entire instrument.



\section{Challenges}

\subsection{Scientific Challenges}
Radio astronomers are trying to answer a very diverse set of questions. 
%Let’s think about what we’re actually trying to do%Deal with a diverse set of questions
%Are we alone?%When were the first stars and galaxies formed?%Galactic structure and formation (mapping the galaxy)%Nature of gravitational wave background (pulsar timing)%Transient universe%Black hole imaging%Searching for extrasolar planets

%Number of antennas%Bandwidth%Number of channels%Filter shapes%Integration time%Algorithms%Etc…

%Spectrometer%Beamformer%Add signals from multiple antennas together to improve SNR%Pulsar processor%Detect dispersed pulse%Interferometer/correlator%Cross-correlate signals from many antennas to combine into a spectral image%Increase angular resolution

%Spectrometer%Filter bank/FFT%Accumulation%Beamformer%FFT%Phase shift%Adders%Pulsar processor%FFT%Deconvolution%Interferometer/correlator%FFT%Cross correlation (multipliers)%Accumulation

\subsection{Technological Challenges}

%Large number of small antennas to improve sensitivity and resolution%Small antennas are very low cost%Creates very high performance signal processing requirements
%Need to combine the antennas together to form a single image or beam%Interferometry computation requirements scale as N2 (N = number of antennas) ~100Tops
