\section{Motivation}
%Design Space
%Increasing%Design time%Design complexity%Performance%Cost (in low volume)%vs
%Decreasing%Power (watts)%Flexibility

%Assessing tradeoffs
%3 GHz bandwidth
%100-200 MHz bandwidth
%Fixed point
%Floating point
%Streaming designs
%Conditional/Iterative programming
%Difficult to program (HDL)
%Easy to program (CUDA)
%Difficult to achieve peak performance
%Difficult to achieve peak performance
%$$
%$
%Lots of available IO
%Limited IO

%Traditional instrument design
%Traditionally observatories build custom instruments%High cost due to custom designed %boards%backplanes%chips %protocols%software%Development takes 5 to 10 years%Hardware is out of date by the time it’s released%Difficult to upgrade/modify without a redesign
