%Summary: summarize work and impact, describe directions for further work, describe how this provides a framework for an end to end solution in radio astronomy as well as other domain specific applications
%Goal: show everything worked and was awesome
%State: needs results, should be quick to write but difficult to write now

%TODO: explain this in text

\section{Future Work}
%Allow blocks to span multiple boards

%Divide blocks between boards (?)

%Design algorithm aspects like 

%Do a better job of preserving symmetry

%Use for other fields

%Design interconenct
