%Summary: describe how we get real numbers to put into previous part
%Goal: define and obtain real numbers from the previous part
%\section{Benchmarks}


%\subsection{Cost}





%Summary: case studies describing partitioning of realistic-scale instruments
%Goal: show successful application of tool to design of realistic instruments
%provide analysis comparing this to hand-designed instruments 
\section{Spectrometer Case Study}
Simple spectrometer placement

Include appropriate FFT or PFB benchmarks

\section{High Resolution Spectrometer Case Study}
results for hi res spectrometer (gbt and seti)

Serendip 6 300MHz 7 ant 2 pol

1Hz resolution (256 million channels)

Greenbank 2.5GHz 1 beam 2 pols

1 Hz resolution

Same benchmarks as before, just discuss large bw, multi stage fft
