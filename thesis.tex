I appreciate all the time and patience he put in to help me get to this point.
I am also grateful to my co-advisor Professor John Wawrzynek for his guidance which helped motivate me and helped me develop my own research ideas. 
I would like to thank the members of my qual and dissertation committees, Professor Aaron Parsons, Professor Jan Rabaey, and Professor Geoff Bower for their time and help shaping this work.
I also would like to thank Professor Don Backer for his wisdom and support.
Although he is no longer with us, he made a lasting impact on my research and I am very grateful for that.

I also need to thank the members of my research group and my lab.
Thanks to the members of CASPER and the BWRC, especially Mark Wagner, Jonathon Kocz, Peter McMahon, Henry Chen, Matt Dexter, Dave MacMahon, and Andrew Siemion.
I appreciate the time everyone took teaching me, helping me debug things, and discussing my research. 

Finally, I would like to thank the people who looked after me and brightened my time at UC Berkeley.
Thanks to my parents and my sister Michelle for always being around whenever I needed them.
I thank my boyfriend Ben Schrager and his family who welcomed me into their home and treated me like family.
