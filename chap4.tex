\chapter{High Level Toolflow}
%Summary: Introduce idea of end to end toolflow%Goal: Defend the idea that we can design an instrument using only a simple high level specification%1
%State: Can be partially written now%The end description will likely change based on the partitioning results

%Summary: describe CASPER, PASP and reconfigurable heterogeneous setispec Goals:%describe the existence and continued development of ”blocks”%show the ability to design reconfigurable instruments by adding a layer of ab- straction to the CASPER+xgpu work%State: Can be written now%Content already exists in the form of talks and a short paper.
