\chapter{Algorithm Partitioning}

%Summary: add on the idea of the partitioner to reconfigurable instrumentation rather than the partitioning coming from a person we can use a computer to optimize this
%describe linear program in detail
%describe and defend design choices/heuristics/approximations
%Goal: show how to do cost-driven partitioning of a design
%for now ”cost” and ”performance” are still variables
%State: intro to ILP can be written now. documenting the actual ILP for this application will be done after the analysis/results

\section{Constraints}

\section{Cost}

\section{Optimization}


\section{Performance}
%TODO: this will have to be written after ch 6 is complete, to make sure we are benchmarking the correct thing. in the meantime we'll write in introduction
