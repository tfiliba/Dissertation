\subsection{Metropolis}
Abhijit Davare. Automated mapping for heterogeneous multiprocessor embedded systems. PhD thesis, 2007. 
Provides an abstract block based description of the system (Metropolis)Easy to stitch algorithms together Simulation is abstracted from the eventual hardware implementationMapping is focused on scheduling onto heterogeneous platformsStrong focus on embedded systems

Some people have thought about how to use technologyMetropolis works on simulation extensively (supporting Embedded systems – we have 1 cpu and 1 dsp let’s make it go fast
This doesn’t solve our problemJust does scheduling

Doesn’t help design the clusterA “heterogeneous node” has a fixed mix of resourcesCan’t reduce costs by throwing away certain types of hardwareOptimization is based on a fixed architecture and flexible performanceDoesn’t match our “always running” modelPerformance is “good enough”, not an optimization target
