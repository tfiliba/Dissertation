The DiFX Correlator is a scalable software implementation of an FX Correlator. 
%DiFX (Distributed FX Correlator) is a scalable software implementation
%Designed for VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry)
%Requires a large cluster to do a lot of computation
%64 MHz, 10 antennas required ~100 nodes in 2007

%CASPER = Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research
%Identifies commonly used DSP blocks for radio astronomy
%FFTs (tunable bandwidth, number of channels, real or complex)
%Polyphase filter banks
%Accumulators
%Digital downconverters/mixers
%Scripts are used to configure parameterized blocks

%Modular Hardware
%Low number of FPGA board designs
%Can be upgraded piecemeal or all together
%Standard signal processing model which is consistent between upgrades

%Boards work with a variety of ADCs/DACs etc.
%Dual input 8 bit 1 Gsps (or 2 Gsps single input interleaved)
%3 Gsps single input 8 bit ADC (interleave 2 for 6 Gsps)
%Provides tested hardware for new instruments

\section{Tuning} \label{Related Work:Tuning}
\subsection{Metropolis}
%Abhijit Davare. Automated mapping for heterogeneous multiprocessor embedded systems. PhD thesis, 2007.
 
%Provides an abstract block based description of the system (Metropolis)
%Easy to stitch algorithms together 
%Simulation is abstracted from the eventual hardware implementation
%Mapping is focused on scheduling onto heterogeneous platforms
%Strong focus on embedded systems

%Some people have thought about how to use technology
%Metropolis works on simulation extensively (supporting 
%Embedded systems – we have 1 cpu and 1 dsp let’s make it go fast
%This doesn’t solve our problem
%Just does scheduling

%Doesn’t help design the cluster
%A “heterogeneous node” has a fixed mix of resources
%Can’t reduce costs by throwing away certain types of hardware
%Optimization is based on a fixed architecture and flexible performance
%Doesn’t match our “always running” model
%Performance is “good enough”, not an optimization target
